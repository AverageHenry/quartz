# General Prep Strategy & Schedule

---

## Study Order:
1. Foundations (pre-lecture videos)
2. Lectures
3. Practice & Supplemental Lectures

Each unit should take 7 days or less to complete. Any extra days left over will go towards practice or supplemental lectures.

Once I'm finished with the curriculum, I will move over to [Neetcode's Top 150](https://neetcode.io/) (Blind Top 75 already included in this list.)

After that, I will do top Google questions on Leetcode.
