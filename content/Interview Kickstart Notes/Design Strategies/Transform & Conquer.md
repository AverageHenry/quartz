# Transform & Conquer

---

### General Overview:
Involves rearranging the input in one of two ways:
- Input rearrangement ([[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Sorting Foundations/Presorting]], for example)
- Data representation (Representing data in a different manner, a min heap, for example)

See examples of [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Sorting Foundations/Sorting Algorithms/Heapsort]].
