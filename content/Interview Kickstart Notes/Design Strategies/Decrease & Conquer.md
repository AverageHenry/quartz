# Decrease & Conquer Strategy

## General Overview of Strategy:
- Solve the problem by solving a small portion of the problem (subproblem), element by element, until the entire problem is solved.

Example: Solving the last element *i* in an array when the first **n - 1** elements are solved.


See examples of [[Selection Sort]] and [[Insertion Sort]].
