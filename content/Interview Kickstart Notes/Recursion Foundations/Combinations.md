# Combinations - C(n, k)
Number of ways to choose k objects out of n, where repetition is not allowed and order is also not important?

C(n, k) = The number of subsets of size k we can create out of n elements.
C(n, n) = ?
C(n, 0) = ?

> [!NOTE]
> Pascal's Triangle is a great example to show how combinations are calculated.
