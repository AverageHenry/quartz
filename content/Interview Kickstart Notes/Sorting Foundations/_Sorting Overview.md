### Goals
##### Should be able to:
- Solve problems using sorting algorithms, or extensions of sorting algorithms.
- Implement popular sorting algorithms quickly:
	- [ ] Merge Sort: **< 10 min**
	- [ ] Quicksort: **< 10 min**
	- [ ] Heapsort: **< 5 min**
- Understand how presorting can make more complex problems more straightforward.

## Algorithm Design Strategies

- ### [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Design Strategies/Brute Force]]

- ### [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Design Strategies/Decrease & Conquer]]

- ### [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Design Strategies/Divide & Conquer]]

- ### [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Design Strategies/Transform & Conquer]]

When trying to solve a programming problem, it's always nice to look at each of these strategies and see witch one would be the most useful.

### Extra Notes
[[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Sorting Foundations/Presorting]] is a [[content/Interview Kickstart Notes/Design Strategies/Transform & Conquer]] strategy and is a great way to approach many problems. It can make the problem you are trying to solve much more clear by transforming the data (sorting the data).
