### Goals
##### Should be able to:
- Solve problems using sorting algorithms, or extensions of sorting algorithms.
- Implement popular sorting algorithms quickly:
	- [ ] Merge Sort: **< 10 min**
	- [ ] Quicksort: **< 10 min**
	- [ ] Heapsort: **< 5 min**
- Understand how presorting can make more complex problems more straightforward.

## Algorithm Design Strategies

- ### [[Brute Force]]

- ### [[Decrease & Conquer]]

- ### [[Divide & Conquer]]

- ### [[Transform & Conquer]]

When trying to solve a programming problem, it's always nice to look at each of these strategies and see witch one would be the most useful.

## Special-Case Sorting Algorithms:
- ###### [[Counting Sort]]
- ###### [[Radix Sort]] - Extension of Counting Sort

### Extra Notes
[[Presorting]] is a [[Transform & Conquer]] strategy and is a great way to approach many problems. It can make the problem you are trying to solve much more clear by transforming the data (sorting the data).
